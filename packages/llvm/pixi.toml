# SYCL Toolkit Package
# Intel DPC++ SYCL compiler with NVIDIA CUDA support
#
# Build with:
#   pixi build
#
# This builds the sycl-toolkit package containing:
#   - Runtime libraries (libsycl.so, etc.)
#   - Development files (headers, cmake modules)
#   - Compiler and tools (clang++, sycl-ls, etc.)
#
# Build Strategy:
#   The build runs directly in the repo/ directory (not a copy) to enable
#   incremental builds. Subsequent builds will only recompile changed files.
